# Hi, I'm Emma Moody 👋

## About Me
Currently taking CSC-113 AI Fundamentals and learning to collaborate with AI tools!

## My Foo 🎯
My passion is gaming, I enjoy playing games such as valorant, apex, siege, and sometimes roblox. That's my main thing, but I also don't have anything specifically correlating into hobbies, 
I asked some people around me and when they think of me they just think of a person who's very socially outgoing and very caring.
So, i'd say my passion is making others around me happy. Whatever they do, I do.  <3
